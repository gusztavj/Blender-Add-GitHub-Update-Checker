## Disclaimer

This add-on is provided as-is. Use at your own risk. No warranties, no guarantee, no liability, no matter what happens. Still I tried to make sure no weird things happen:

* This module is intended to check a GitHub repository of your choice to get information on the latest published version of whatever is contained in the given repository.
* **CAUTION.** This module requires an access token to the GitHub repository. The token is stored as clean text.
  * Make sure to create a personal token restricted to only access the repos you want everyone to be able to access restricted to access code only restricted to only read code.
  * Note that your personal token expires in a year (or sooner if you decided so). Update check won't work afterwards. To not  disturb your users, such errors are ignored silently. Make sure to change the code and update the token to a newer one before the current expires.
* **CAUTION.** When people use your add-on using this module, they can generate many requests against your repo, and your GitHub rate limit may be exceeded. To overcome this, be sure to set a proper frequency, but don't forget, users will have access to your source code and may change it.
* This template assumes you use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) for your add-on. See [Release Tagging Rules](/README.md#release-tagging-rules) for more information.
